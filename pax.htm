<h2> OVERVIEW <h2>
<p>
The International Press is a specialized committee with a unique function - to report and comment on the proceedings of other MUN committees. 
The Press is that segment of MUN that has the freedom to listen to debates and express independent opinions on those debates. Press members observe committees
and produce informative and creative newsletters on the discourse. Articles range from op-eds to fluffs, while pictures and caricatures often depict the 
humorous side of MUN. Through its articles, pictures and caricatures, the Press both informs and entertains all. The unique experience that the IP holds – 
ranging from frantically running through committee rooms to getting an opportunity to express your most profound thoughts about how much food means to you – 
is truly one that cannot be found anywhere else.
